## Introduction

Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) is a statistical methodology in a
class of models that model the mean of of an outcome as function of
predictor variables commonly used to analyze correlated data in various
fields that use panel or longitudinal data, including epidemiology,
social sciences, and clinical trials [@Mcculloch2008]. The method was
first introduced by Liang and Zeger in a paper in 1986.
[@Liang1986longitudinal]. The method uses a quasilikelihood approach and yields population averaged estimates of parameters. [@wang2014generalized] 

Analysis of longitudinal data has inherent problems with independence involving multiple observations for the same individual in clinical data studies. Liang and Zeger even referred to
time dependence on multiple observations of an individual as a nuisance due to correlation issues. [@Liang1986longitudinal]. Another challenge for use of longitudinal data is the need for more complex statistical models to deal with the lack of independence in observations that could
include multidimensional levels of integration, and the software is often not available.[@donald2006longitudinal] The use of GEE mitigates these challenges with use of longitudinal data.

GEE extends the generalized linear model framework to account for
within-cluster correlations, such as repeated observations or clustered
data. [@shao2023comparison] GEE is used to model the marginal mean
response while allowing for flexible correlation structures among
observations within the same group or cluster. GEE estimates
population-average effects by specifying a working correlation structure
such as independence or exchangeable structures.[@shao2023comparison]
GEE also implements an estimating equation approach to iteratively
update the parameter estimates.

This methodology provides reliable and robust estimates, even when the
correlation structure is mis-specified.[@wang2014generalized] GEE is particularly useful for
longitudinal or panel data analysis, as it allows for examination of all
available data in the experiment and provides statistical inference for
population-level ramifications. [@lin2011impact] Its ability to handle
missing data makes GEE a great choice for analyzing correlated data,
particularly in biostatistics or research settings without the use of intense statistical mathematics.


## Methodology

### Data Structure

GEE is designed for analyzing correlated data, such as longitudinal or
panel data. The data are organized into clusters, where each cluster
represents a group of related observations. An example to demonstrate GEE
uses a dataset with repeated measures on the same patient for medical
results over time.

### Model Specification

GEE uses a generalized linear model (GLM) framework to specify the
relationship between the response variable and the regressor variables.
[@shao2023comparison] The choice of the link function and the
distribution of the response variable depends on the nature of the data.
[@gayen2018generalized] The table below shows the extension of GEE from
the GLM and LM and differences in assumptions.

![](Model_Comparison_Table.jpg)


According the Liang and Zeger, the method of GEE, longitudinal data
sets, are comprised of an outcome variable, $y_{it}$, and
\$\$p\\times1\$\$ vector of covariates, $x_{it}$, observed at times
$$t=1,...,n_{it}$$ for subjects $$i=1,...,K$$ which arise often in
applied sciences. [@Liang1986longitudinal] For example, in health care
study data, individual patients have follow visits to monitor a
treatment plan and therefore have multiple observations for each
patient. GEE is used for these kind of longitudinal datasets due to the use of correlation structures in its modeling design.

GEE employ a logistic regression model created using the 'geepack'
package available in R, specifying a correlation structure (see the
structure types in the paragraph below), family type of binomial for
discrete outcomes and would yield model of

General mathematical formula for multivariate GEE:  $$
 \text{logit}[P(y_\text{ij}=1)]=log\left(\dfrac{\pi_{ij}}{1-\pi_{ij}}\right)=\beta_0+Regressor1_{ij}\beta_1+Regressor2_{ij}\beta_2...+RegressorN\beta_{N-1}
$$

that predicts log odds ratios for outcomes for each predictor. [@PSU2023]

### Correlation Structures

GEE allows for flexible modeling of the correlation structure within
clusters. A working correlation structure is specified, which represents
the assumed relationship among the correlated observations
[@seals2016analysis]. The correlation structures discussed in this paper
are exchangeable, autoregressive (AR1), unstructured, and independent.

![Figure 1: Correlation Structures Comparison Table [@wang2012penalized]](corr-table.jpg)

The The independence correlation structure is used when the assumption
between multiple repeated observations of a single individual is
independent. Use of the exchange correlation structure is used when
there is equality between times of observations. Autoagressive (AR1)
correlation structure is used when there are more than one set of equal
time differences between repeated observations. And lastly, unstructured
correlation structure is the most general and takes into account all the
possible time intervals between repeated observations. Of course there
are more choices for correlation structures, but these (4) structures are
the structures used in the 'geepack' R package used in the subsequent
examples.

If the correlation structure chosen for GEE is not correct, the predictor variables will still be estimated consistently, since the GEE method relies on the first moment, however the standard errors will be incorrect. This considered very attractive property of GEE models.[@donald2006longitudinal] A possible remedy for choosing a correlation structure incorrectly is to use the 'sandwich' package in R that uses the Huber-White sandwich estimator to create an an approximation for the correlation.[@homish2010analyzing] [@zeileis2019package]


Correlation structure selection is determined through various methods.
One valid method used to determine model selection has been proposed by
Shults and Chaganty (@wang2012penalized) as to determine the structure
based on the generalized error sum of squares given by the following
equation: 
$$
  ESS(\alpha,\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^{K}{(Y_i - \mu _i)}'{V_{i}}^{-1}(Y_i - \mu _i)
$$.


### Estimating Equations

Instead of maximizing the likelihood function, GEE employs an estimating
equation approach to estimate the regression parameters.
[@d2011generalized] The estimating equations are derived based on the
assumed correlation structure and the marginal mean model.
[@d2011generalized] These equations capture the population-averaged
effects of the explanatory variables.

### Iterative Algorithm

GEE uses an iterative algorithm, typically based on the Newton-Raphson
method, to update the parameter estimates. The process involves solving
the estimating equations iteratively until convergence is reached.
[@wang2012penalized] It is an asymptotic approach versus a least squares regression approach.{this needs further sources, read through docs

## Analysis and Results

### Data and Vizualisation

In this review of GEE, the 'geepack' package for R with a respiratory
dataset included was used to showcase an example. [@Hojsgaard2006]
[@Yan2004] [@Yan2002] The respiratory dataset included in the packet is
an example of longitudinal or panel data as data is from a clinical
study of 111 patients receiving treatment for a respiratory illness.

The above graphic is displaying a small sample from the 'respiratory' data. The given data set is a study with longitudinal data of repeated measures with a binary outcome. There are four measures, or visits, performed on each individual. Each box with 1 through 4 on the x-axis represents a unique patient and their respective visits. The y-axis displays the treatment the patient is taking where P represents a placebo and A represents the actual treatment.

The points on the plot indicate the outcome of treatment and represent a patient's respiratory status per visit where 1 indicates a "good" respiratory status and 0 indicates a "poor" respiratory status. Note that this graphic is a truncated form of the complete dataset and excludes both a treatment center and 52 other patients.

### Statistical Modeling

```{r}
# GLM Model
glm_example <- glm(outcome ~ center + treat + age + baseline + sex, data=respiratory,                
          family = binomial())

summary(glm_example)
```
The Generalized Linear Model,

```{r}
# GLMM Model
glmm_example <- glmmTMB(outcome ~ center + treat + age + baseline + sex + (1 | id),
                 data = respiratory, family = binomial())

summary(glmm_example)

```

GEE formula for the respiratory data: 
$$
 \log\left(\dfrac{\pi_{ij}}{1-\pi_{ij}}\right)=\beta_0+Center_{ij}\beta_1+Treat_i\beta_2+Age_i\beta_3+Sex_i\beta_4+Baseline_i\beta_5
$$
```{r}
# GEE with independence correlation structure
gee_independence <- geeglm(outcome ~ center + treat + age + baseline + sex, data=respiratory, id=id, 
                  family = binomial(), corstr="independence")

# GEE with exchangeable correlation structure
gee_exchangeable <- geeglm(outcome ~ center + treat + age + baseline + sex, data=respiratory, id=id, 
                  family = binomial(), corstr="exchangeable")

# GEE with unstructured correlation structure
gee_unstructured <- geeglm(outcome ~ center + treat + age + baseline + sex, data=respiratory, id=id, 
                  family = binomial(), corstr="unstructured")

# GEE with Auto-Regressive Order 1 correlation structure
gee_ar1 <- geeglm(outcome ~ center + treat + age + baseline, data=respiratory, id=id, 
                  family = binomial(), corstr="ar1")  


# Displays table of QIC between all 4 different types of GEE models with different
# correlation structure
QIC(gee_independence, gee_exchangeable, gee_unstructured, gee_ar1)
```

### Model Assessment

After fitting the GEE model, various model diagnostics can be performed
to assess the model's goodness of fit, such as model comparison criteria
and assessing the adequacy of the assumed correlation structure.
[@shao2023comparison]


### Inference

GEE provides robust standard errors for the estimated regression
parameters, taking into account the correlation structure. When
comparing multiple different techniques, it's important to consider the
correlation between observations in order to perform accurate
statistical inference of the model's output. [@seals2016analysis]
Hypothesis tests and confidence intervals can be constructed to assess
the statistical significance of the variables and make inferences about
the population-level effects. [@shao2023comparison]




### Conclusion

Comparison of model results:



GEE is a valid choice of statistical modeling to be used in the case
that a standard regression model is not applicable due to the
between-observation relationship within data. This directly applies to
research cases and other applications that utilize clustered or
longitudinal data. If a GEE model is not used and the between-segment
correlation is ignored, then there may be an incorrect conclusion of
significant results, or type I errors. [@seals2016analysis]

GEE uses quasi-likelihood estimation which is opposite of other models
that use maximum likelihood estimation or the least squares methods.
