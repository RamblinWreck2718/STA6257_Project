## Introduction

Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) is a statistical methodology in a class of models that model the mean of of an outcome as function of predictor variables
commonly used to analyze correlated data in various fields that use
panel or longitudinal data, including epidemiology, social sciences, and
clinical trials @Mcculloch2008. The method was first introduced by Liang
and Zeger in a paper entitled "Longitudinal Data Analysis Using
Generalized Linear Models" in 1986. @Liang1986longitudinal. Analysis of
longitudinal data has inherent problems with independence involving
multiple observations for the same individual in clinical data studies.
Liang and Zeger even referred to time dependence on multiple
observations of an individual as a nuisance due to correlation issues.
@Liang1986longitudinal. Another challenge for use of longitudinal data
is the need for more complex statistical models to deal with the lack of
independence in observations that could include multidimensional levels
of integration, and the software is often not
available.\@donald2006longitudinal The use of GEE mitigates these
challenges with use of longitudinal data.

GEE extends the generalized linear model framework to account for
within-cluster correlations, such as repeated observations or clustered
data @shao2023comparison. GEE is used to model the marginal mean
response while allowing for flexible correlation structures among
observations within the same group or cluster. GEE estimates
population-average effects by specifying a working correlation structure
such as independence or exchangeable structures @shao2023comparison. GEE
also implements an estimating equation approach to iteratively update
the parameter estimates.

This methodology provides reliable and robust estimates, even when the
correlation structure is mis-specified. GEE is particularly useful for
longitudinal or panel data analysis, as it allows for examination of all
available data in the experiment and provides statistical inference for
population-level ramifications @lin2011impact. Its ability to handle
missing data makes GEE a great choice for analyzing correlated data,
particularly in biostatistics or research settings.

General mathematical formula for multivariate GEE: @PSU2023. $$
 \log\left(\dfrac{\pi_{ij}}{1-\pi_{ij}}\right)=\beta_0+Regressor1_{ij}\beta_1+Regressor2_{ij}\beta_2...+RegressorN\beta_{N-1}
$$

## Methods

### Data Structure

GEE is designed for analyzing correlated data, such as longitudinal or
panel data. The data are organized into clusters, where each cluster
represents a group of related observations. An example is repeated
measures on the same patient for medicinal results over time.

### Model Specification

GEE uses a generalized linear model (GLM) framework to specify the
relationship between the response variable and the regressor variables
@shao2023comparison. The choice of the link function and the
distribution of the response variable depends on the nature of the data
@gayen2018generalized.

### Correlation Structure

GEE allows for flexible modeling of the correlation structure within
clusters. A working correlation structure is specified, which represents
the assumed relationship among the correlated observations
@seals2016analysis. The correlation structures discussed in this paper
are exchangeable, autoregressive (AR1), unstructured, and independence.



### Estimating Equations

Instead of maximizing the likelihood function, GEE employs an estimating
equation approach to estimate the regression parameters
@d2011generalized. The estimating equations are derived based on the
assumed correlation structure and the marginal mean model
@d2011generalized. These equations capture the population-averaged
effects of the explanatory variables.

### Iterative Algorithm

GEE uses an iterative algorithm, typically based on the Newton-Raphson
method, to update the parameter estimates. The process involves solving
the estimating equations iteratively until convergence is reached.
@wang2012penalized. {this needs further sources, read through docs
again}

### Inference

GEE provides robust standard errors for the estimated regression
parameters, taking into account the correlation structure. When
comparing multiple different techniques, it's important to consider the
correlation between observations in order to perform accurate
statistical inference of the model's output. @seals2016analysis.
Hypothesis tests and confidence intervals can be constructed to assess
the statistical significance of the variables and make inferences about
the population-level effects @shao2023comparison.

### Model Assessment

After fitting the GEE model, various model diagnostics can be performed
to assess the model's goodness of fit, such as model comparison criteria
and assessing the adequacy of the assumed correlation structure
@shao2023comparison.

## Analysis and Results

### Data and Vizualisation

In this review of GEE, the 'geepack' package for R with a respiratory
dataset included was used to showcase an example. @Hojsgaard2006
@Yan2004 @Yan2002 The respiratory dataset included in the packet is an
example of longitudinal or panel data as data is from a clinical study
of 111 patients receiving treatment for a respiratory illness.

![Correlation Structures Table @wang2012penalized](corr-table.jpg)

An important component of GEE is the correlation structure. The table
above shows the different correlation structures that are used for GEE
models and the respective correlation, sample matrix, and estimator. A
correlation structure is used within a GEE to determine the pattern of
observations within a cluster. This can be denoted by size *n*\_i x
*n*\_i and is dependent on a vector of affiliated parameters.
@wang2012penalized. The four correlation structures we focused on for
our data analysis are independent, exchangeable, unstructured, and
auto-regressive order 1. An exchangeable structure assumes that the
variance is equal between all clusters and so all clusters also are
correlated to eachother equally. @seals2016analysis. The independent
structure has the assumption that all observations are independent and
the clusters are not correlated. @seals2016analysis. The unstructured
structure does not assume any specific relationship between clusters or
observations within the data. @seals2016analysis.\
Correlation structure selection is determined through various methods.
One valid method used to determine model selection has been proposed by
Shults and Chaganty (@wang2012penalized) as to determine the structure
based on the generalized error sum of squares given by the following
equation: $$
  ESS(\alpha,\beta) = \sum_{i=1}^{K}{(Y_i - \mu _i)}'{V_{i}}^{-1}(Y_i - \mu _i)
$$ Another potential formula used to determine the best correlation
structure to use in a GEE model has been proposed by

### Conclusion

GEE is a valid choice of statistical modeling to be used in the case
that a standard regression model is not applicable due to the
between-observation relationship within data. This directly applies to
research cases and other applications that utilize clustered or
longitudinal data. If a GEE model is not used and the between-segment
correlation is ignored, then there may be an incorrect conclusion of
significant results, or type I errors. @seals2016analysis.

GEE uses quasi-likelihood estimation which is opposite of other models
that use maximum likelihood estimation or the least squares methods.
@shao2023comparison. To summarize, a maximum likelihood estimation
