## Introduction

Generalized Estimating Equations (GEE) is a statistical methodology in a class of models that model the mean of an outcome as function of predictor variables commonly used to analyze correlated data in various fields that use panel or longitudinal data, including epidemiology, social sciences, and clinical trials [@Mcculloch2008]. The method was first introduced by Liang and Zeger in a paper in 1986. [@Liang1986longitudinal]. The method uses a quasilikelihood approach and yields population averaged estimates of parameters. [@wang2014generalized]

Analysis of longitudinal data has inherent problems with independence involving multiple observations for the same individual in clinical data studies and GEE handles the dependence between observations.

## Methods

-   Estimating Equations

-   Iterative Algorithm

-   Data Structure

-   Model Specification

-   Correlation Structures

## Methods - Estimating Equations

GEE is designed for analyzing correlated data, such as longitudinal or panel data in which the data is organized into clusters, where each cluster represents a group of related observations.[@Mcculloch2008] The assumption of independent observations may not be accurate. A GEE analysis of a dataset with longitudinal data with repeated observations per individual will be shown using the respiratory dataset available through the 'geepack' package in R.

## Methods - Iterative Algorithm

GEE uses an iterative algorithm after using initial estimates for regression coefficients, $\beta_i$, to update the parameter estimates. Software packages, such as 'geepack' package in R handle the iteration process. The iterative process works until there is convergence to stable estimates. [@Hojsgaard2006] [@Liang1986longitudinal]

## Methods - Data Structure

GEE is designed for analyzing correlated data, such as longitudinal or panel data in which the data is organized into clusters, where each cluster represents a group of related observations.[@Mcculloch2008] The assumption of independent observations may not be accurate. A GEE analysis of a dataset with longitudinal data with repeated observations per individual will be shown using the respiratory dataset available through the 'geepack' package in R.

## Methods - Model Specification

GEE is an extension of generalized linear models (GLM) and uses that framework to specify the relationship between the response variable and the regressor variables. [@shao2023comparison] The choice of the link function and the distribution of the response variable depends on the nature of the data.[@gayen2018generalized] Models can be created for continuous, binary or count outcomes. The table below shows the extension of GEE from the LM, GLM,and GLMM and differences in assumptions.

## Methods - Correlation Structures

GEE allows for flexible modeling of the correlation structure within clusters. A working correlation structure is specified, which represents the assumed relationship among the correlated observations [@seals2016analysis].

-   [Independent]{.underline} - Assumption that all individual observations are independent
-   [Exchangeable]{.underline} - Assumption there is equality of time between observations
-   [Autoregressive (AR1]{.underline}) - Assumption that there are more than one set of equality of times between observations
-   [Unstructured]{.underline} - Most general and takes into account all possible times possible between observations

## Statistical Modeling: GG w/Independent Correlation Structure

```{r}
library(tidyverse)
library(knitr)
library(geepack)
library(lme4)   # For fitting linear mixed models
library(glmmTMB)  # For fitting GLMMs with different distributions
library(ggeffects)
library(dplyr)
library(ggplot2)
library(furniture)

# GEE with independent correlation structure
gee_independence <- geeglm(outcome ~ center + treat + age + baseline + sex, data=respiratory, id=id, 
                  family = binomial(), corstr="independence")
summary(gee_independence)
```

## Statistical Modeling: GG w/Exchangeable Correlation Structure

```{r}
# GEE with exchangeable correlation structure
gee_exchangeable <- geeglm(outcome ~ center + treat + age + baseline + sex, data=respiratory, id=id, 
                  family = binomial(), corstr="exchangeable")
summary(gee_exchangeable)

```

## Statistical Modeling: GG w/Autoregressive Correlation Structure

```{r}
# GEE with Auto-Regressive Order 1 correlation structure
gee_ar1 <- geeglm(outcome ~ center + treat + age + baseline + sex, data=respiratory, id=id, 
                  family = binomial(), corstr="ar1")
summary(gee_ar1)

```


## Statistical Modeling: GG w/Unstructured Correlation Structure

```{r}
# GEE with unstructured correlation structure
gee_unstructured <- geeglm(outcome ~ center + treat + age + baseline + sex, data=respiratory, id=id, 
                  family = binomial(), corstr="unstructured")
summary(gee_unstructured)
gee_unstructured$geese$alpha

```

## Statistical Modeling: Model Assessment

The following formula is the logistic regression model unique to the
respiratory data set. This formula was translated into the four
different models above with a different correlation structure specified
per model.


$$
 \log\left(\dfrac{\pi_{ij}}{1-\pi_{ij}}\right)=\beta_0+Center_{ij}\beta_1+Treat_i\beta_2+Age_i\beta_3+Sex_i\beta_4+Baseline_i\beta_5
$$

## Statistical Modeling: QIC for Model Selection

```{r}
# Displays table of QIC between all 4 different types of GEE models with different
# correlation structure
QIC(gee_independence, gee_exchangeable, gee_unstructured, gee_ar1)

```


## Statistical Modeling: Inference

GEE provides robust standard errors for the estimated regression
parameters, taking into account the correlation structure. When
comparing multiple different techniques, it's important to consider the
correlation between observations in order to perform accurate
statistical inference of the model's output. [@seals2016analysis]
Hypothesis tests and confidence intervals can be constructed to assess
the statistical significance of the variables and make inferences about
the population-level effects. [@shao2023comparison]

## Conclusion

GEE is a valid choice of statistical modeling to be used in cases when
assumptions for linear regression models and generalized linear models
do not hold such as datasets with non-normal data, dependence in
observations, longitudinal or panel data, clustered or correlated data.
In addition, when there are large amounts of higher dimensional data and
finding the likelihood functions is very difficult computationally, GEE
provides an easy alternative and gives stable, consistent estimates for
parameters without the need for the possibly intense likelihood
calculations. GEE can be used for continuous, binary or count responses.
